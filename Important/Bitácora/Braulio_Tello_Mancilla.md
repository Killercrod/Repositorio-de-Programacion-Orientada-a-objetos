# Organization
* My record will be organized by months, which aligns with the monthly deliveries of the work.
<details> <summary>First month</summary>
  
### About the meetings
---
  For the firs month we had some meetings in which we talked about things the project's needs, with a brainstorm session we completed the requirements done, talking about the functional and non functional requirements, for my part i gave ideas for the final requirements.
  Due to our personal schedules with other classes we couldn't work much during the meetings, so we only shared some ideas, organized our work system and gathered a bit of information.
  
### About the individual work
---
  For this submission i contributed doing some refinements to the repository, ensuring everythings was in its place and adding the links to the main files.
  Then i helped with the script, making it simple but full of the information it needed, fixing the gramar and then translating it into English, because we decided to do our video in English.
  Then i edited the video, uploaded it to youtube and putting the link on the main page.
  And finally i made the Class Diagram together with my partner Omar Chim.</details>

  ### Individual Work
  ---
  In the first weeks of the month i focused on learning how the code works and how to make it function on my laptop, that's why i created the tutorial on how to run the app on windows, going from everything you need to download to how to run the app and how to organizate it
  Then i created an example or more like a "demo" of how to make the link between the HTML and the JAVA app, making a little project with SpringBoot where you introduce your name and it loads a message and show the name added on the terminal, so with this knowledge i will apply it to the real project and make the configurations nedded (also the explanation).
