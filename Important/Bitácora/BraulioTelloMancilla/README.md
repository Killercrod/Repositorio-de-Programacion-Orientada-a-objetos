# Organization 📅✍️
* My record will be organized by months, which aligns with the monthly deliveries of the work.
  
## About the meetings 🎞️
The meetings will be every thursday one and a half hours, is most for see what we have done already and what shoould be done in the next week, so is more for organization than for working, because the work is individual each one work on their home and if there is a problem we talk about it on the group chat.

## About the individual work 👤
---
  For the firs month we had some meetings in which we talked about things the project's needs, with a brainstorm session we completed the requirements done, talking about     the functional and non functional requirements, for my part i gave ideas for the final requirements.
  Due to our personal schedules with other classes we couldn't work much during the meetings, so we only shared some ideas, organized our work system and gathered a bit of    information.

  For this submission i contributed doing some refinements to the repository, ensuring everythings was in its place and adding the links to the main files.
  Then i helped with the script, making it simple but full of the information it needed, fixing the gramar and then translating it into English, because we decided to do      our video in English.
  Then i edited the video, uploaded it to youtube and putting the link on the main page.
  And finally i made the Class Diagram together with my partner Omar Chim.

  ###  
  In the first weeks of the month i focused on learning how the code works and how to make it function on my laptop, that's why i created the tutorial on how to run the app   on windows, going from everything you need to download to how to run the app and how to organizate it
  Then i created an example or more like a "demo" of how to make the link between the HTML and the JAVA app, making a little project with SpringBoot where you introduce       your name and it loads a message and show the name added on the terminal, so with this knowledge i will apply it to the real project and make the configurations nedded     (also the explanation).
  
  [Version 0 document](./version_0) This code is what i've been working on the last days, it conects the html with a java code, using **Spring Boot framework** .
  For make the JAVA code a Web Controller, i use some of the Spring tools like @RestController (For identify the java as the web controller), @RequestParameters (For call     the parameters) and using some others like fetch API that allows to send and request data from the server (JAVA code), in less words it comunicate the frontend with the     backend.

  ## Individual Work 👤

  ###  
 In the last month of the project, I focused on having all the code together, both Python and Java, as well as the front end. Practically, my role was that of a back-end developer since I was in charge of making sure the Java servers that processed the JSON, both from the form and the Python script for taking the photo, worked correctly. I had many problems when trying to put everything together because with each update of the codes, both the UI and the database, and the Python code, the Java code also failed a lot since my colleagues would remove essential parts of my work or change them in a way that I had to review everything again and connect it properly. To make things easier, I created a Java script and a Python script. 

 
  ### Python-App.py 
  This code is used to control the call made by the Flask server when selecting the option from the UI, and to be able to run the script from port 5000, so every time the program was initialized, it would only open it from the port already set up.


  ### Java - CapturaController.java

  
This code was used to call the function from app.py to initialize the port and also processed the obtained information to send it to the database.

It was not an easy task at all, but it was completed. I had a few problems when dockerizing it and uploading it to a domain, so Cesar took care of that since he knows someone who could help us.

Additionally, I also edited the video for this last submission and organized the recording and the script in English.
